- title: Food
  description: The home has a  capacity of 26 children and it is  quite a challenge to offer all a balanced diet. With  the existing high cost of living and ever rising food prices it is  very  hard for  the home to meet its monthly food budget. In absence of resources, the boys are many times fed with the bare minimum required.

- title: Education
  description: Whilst we make every effort reaching out to well-wishers for support for the school and college fees,  it has been extremely challenging especially in the last two years due to the global effect of the Covid Pandemic. We have thus had to suspend  the provision of schooling  to some of our beneficiaries.

- title: Rent
  description: This has been the most challenging. We have been unable to consistently pay the rent, which has led to accumulation of rent arrears.

- title: Medical
  description: The nature of our beneficiaries is such that most have abused drugs while on the streets. Their rehabilitation requires that we also engage health facilities for detoxification, other will have serious skin infections, others have undergone trauma and various abuses while on the streets and require counselling and other health intervention measures.

- title: Clothes
  description: We mostly depend on well-wishers who donate used clothes, shoes etc  to assist our beneficiaries with decent clothing.

- title: Home Tracing
  description:  Our core work is to reconnect those that we rescue from the streets back to their families and communities after successful rehabilitation. This involves lots of travelling to far distances that require significant amount of money.

- title: Stationary
  description: Stationery such as books, pens, pencils and other such items are required  for our rehabilitation programs
