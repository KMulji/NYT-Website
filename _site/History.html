                            House Of Hope initially started off as a feeding program at Shauri Moyo Baptist Church under
                            the
                            patronage of the late Pastor Charles Baraza, where young people and children would come for
                            praise and worship sessions and later we would provide food, clean clothes, clean water and
                            soap
                            to those who were willing to clean themselves. At one session there would be more than 300
                            young
                            people and children who would come mainly to be fed.
                        </h5>
                        <br>
                        <h5>
                            Due to lack of space and the growth pattern the venue at ShauriMoyo Baptist Church coupled
                            with
                            other logistical challenges compelled us to move the project to Ongata Rongai on the 5th of
                            June
                            2003, where we currently operate from. Most of the street children who came, especially the
                            young ones experienced shocking amounts of abuse while on the streets. They were subjected
                            to
                            abuse of drugs, selling of drugs, stealing and worse still sexual abuse. It is from such
                            experiences that we decided to provide a safe haven for this group of young ones and safe
                            guard
                            them from the harsh life on the streets. Some of those rescued through our project had
                            stayed
                            for years on the streets without knowledge of their whereabouts by their families; they had
                            ended up on the streets due to violence in their families, abuses both sexual and physical.
                            Some
                            had lost both their parents when they were young and they were forced to fend for
                            themselves.
                            They were pure survivors at a very young age. Some had been displaced from their homes as a
                            result of political violence, which saw many families dispersed, some killed, their homes
                            torched and property stolen.

                            Ours was to provide love to those who were unloved and despised in the society; it was to
                            give
                            positive spiritual guidance and role modeling, to give each young person that comes through
                            our
                            doors a new sense of self-empowerment, knowledge and respect for themselves and others,
                            among
                            others.

                            Over the 18 years we have been serving at Nyumba ya Tumaini, we have managed to work closely
                            with over 500 children from the streets of Nairobi, Rongai, Kiserian, Matasia, Ngong, and
                            other
                            counties, during this time we also made it our mission to locate and reunite those from the
                            streets with their families where the environment was conducive. We have also managed to
                            take
                            the older boys into various vocational training such as motor vehicle mechanics, carpentry
                            and
                            masonry just to name a few.
