duties: house mother and one house father have been employed to provide a
        familial environment for the children. They have a background in first aid and counseling
        and are therefore a proper first point of contact for children who might be in need of such
        care.
vision: Paying it forward. Restoring hope to the less fortunate. A testimony of hope and kindness that was afforded to me!
