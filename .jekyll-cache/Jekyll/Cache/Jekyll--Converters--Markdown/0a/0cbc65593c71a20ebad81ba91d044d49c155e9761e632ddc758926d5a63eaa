<p>From the Director’s Desk</p>

<p>####</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>Many of us will be glad to see the year 2021 coming to an end. With all the
challenges and stresses that have been experienced with the relentless Covid
situation, a situation that saw many families battle with the loss of loved
ones, the agony of job losses and many other Covid related aftermaths.</p>

<p>Despite all the challenges we are hopeful that this Christmas season will bring
a bundle of joy and fulfilment to may of us. That Christ, the hope of glory will
shine in our heart’s bundles of love and comfort.</p>

<p>Even as we celebrate his birth, we are reminded that He indeed is the reason for
the season, our hearts firmly focused on him.</p>

<p>We are very grateful friends for standing with us through out this year despite
the challenges we faced and continue to face. Your sacrifices have given those
under our care a reason to have hope for a brighter tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Our Numbers</strong></p>

<p>This year alone we have managed to rescue 64 young people and children from the
streets of Nairobi and Kajiado. 23 have since been reconnected back to their
families. Currently, our population stands at 21, with a couple more set for
family reunfication before year end. Initially we had capped the number of boys
we can take in to 16, but the streets are very unfrogiving and the number of
street children continue to rise. At times out of compassion, it becomes very
difficult to leave one out who has begged to be rescued.</p>

<p><strong>Programs 2022</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The focus for 2022 is to enhance our rehabilitation programs. Many times we
have rehabilitated the young people and children and overlooked the
important aspect of rehabilitating the caregivers, especially through
counselling and postive parenting skills. This we hope will lay a strong
foundation for those that are in the process of family reunification be
wholeheartedly welcomed back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The covid pandemic led to some drastic measures to be taken so we can reduce
our expenses, this has had some negative effects on our rehabilitation
programs, some of those that we rescue are not able to go to main schooling
or vocational training and so programs such as beadwork, woven bags and
other skills are essential as some rely on such trainings to source for
their livelihoods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope to help a few families in social ecomomic programs, this is informed
by our recent home tracing experiences ( will share a case scenario below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had suspended payment of school fees due to lack of funds, this has had
its won challenge as some of those we have recently reintegrated have been
unable to continue with their education due to non payment of tuition fees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case Scenario</strong></p>

<p>In one of our home tracing mission last week we came across a very disturbing
scenario. Our mission was simple, home tracing. This we did successfully but
then our social worker noticed that al the 2 children in the homestead had not
gone to school. On further inquiries she found out that the single mother of 3
had been unable to pay for their tuition fees and so the kids were not allowed
back until all fees was settled.</p>

<p>The most unsettling thing is when we learned that one of the girls aged 11 had
been defiled and depsite reporting the matter no action was taken. Our social
worker took up the matter and off she went to the nearest Children offices where
the Children Officer was unaware of this unfortunate occurrence.Luckily the
officer picked up the matter for a quick medical check up and reported the
matter to the police where we expect some action to be taken.</p>

<p>Further, our social worker went to the education office and reported that the
young children had not gone to school due to lack of tuition fees, which in turn
had put them at risk. The education officer intervened on the matter and ensured
all the 3 siblings reported back to school without having to pay the tuition
fees.</p>

<p>This are just some of the scenarios that we come across during our tracings,
some as cruel as they come and yet we stil have to intervene in all cases to
ensure the safety of all that we reconnect woth their families.</p>

<p><strong>RENT ARREARS</strong></p>

<p>We are very grateful to the New Begginings Community Worship Center, NY led by
Rev. Graves and his board for settling our rent arrears upto November 2021. Your
support has given a new lease of hope, it has ensured that House of Hope
continues to shelter those that are rescued from the streets without being
anxious of when the landlord will come knocking at the door. May the good Lord
bless you all at NBCWC for all the sacrifices you have made.</p>

<p><strong>CHRISTMAS PARTY</strong></p>

<p>Christmas is around the corner and we are hoping to have a christmas party for
the boys so they to can enjoy the reason for the season. They are all looking
forward to it, they keep asking what are we going to do for their Christmas.
Ours has been as reassuring as ever, that we will have a party.</p>

<p>We are kindly requesting for any assistance towards making this time a joyful
and fun time for them. This is our request during this Christmas, that we may
afford the boys a wonderful Christmas day. We hope that the boys will for a
moment forget all the challenges they face and just appreciates God’s loving
gift to us all.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYERS</strong></p>

<p>We request that you keep all of the above highlights in your prayers.
Specifically we hope that the year 2022 will bring with it financial
breakthrough for NYT, its been a tough and very stressful year.</p>

<p>In the end you all came through for us, whether by your giving, prayers and
thoughts. We pray that th good Lord bless you all abundantly, may He return in
great measure the kindness you have afforded us.</p>

<p>Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Very blessed New Year 2022.</p>

<p>With Love from NYT.</p>
